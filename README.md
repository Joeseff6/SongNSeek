## Project Description 

The purpose of this project is to create an application that allows the user to stream music, create playlists, and much more. This will be done using a front-end user interface and front-end/back-end logic. Through the interaction of the front end, a user will be accessing a database to store their encrypted login information, as well as perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods for the database.
## What to Expect From the Application

Information in respect to music is being pulled everywhere every day. When you pull up a song on Spotify or Apple Music, information about the track inquired is being pulled at your request. This track information is then displayed to you, while giving the option to save this information to a library in a database.

This project demonstrates the real life application of communication between the front-end (client-side), and the back-end (server-side) when pulling music information. Deezer's API was used to pull information based on the user's search, which is displayed to the user. Once the user selects an option, that selection is saved to a database for storage per the user's library. 

he user will be able to see information in regards to their search, like the artist, album, and song selected. In the future, we plan to use this application for streaming services using auth and request tokens for Deezer users.
