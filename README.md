## Project Description ‚úè 

The purpose of this project is to create an application that allows the user to stream music, create playlists, and much more. This will be done using a front-end user interface and front-end/back-end logic. Through the interaction of the front end, a user will be accessing a database to store their encrypted login information, as well as perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete methods for the database.
## What to Expect From the Application

Music applications are an everyday part of the daily life. Users will stream music on apps like Apple Music, Spotify, and Deezer while driving in traffic, working out, or even working in the office. 

Users can utilize this application to relax and stream their favorite songs, while having the option to customize playlists to either fit a mood or fit into their environment. They will be able to create, update, or delete their playlist to make the user experience completely personal. An important feature to this application, and what also makes it personal, is the ability to create a new user so that the user's library is specific to them. This means that a login will be required, such that the user's session is saved until they log out.
