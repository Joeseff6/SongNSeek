## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to create an application that allows the user to stream music, create playlists, and much more. This will be done using front-end application and back-end logic.
## What to Expect From the Application

Music applications are an everyday part of the daily life. Users will stream music on apps like Apple Music, Spotify, and Deezer while driving in traffic, working out, or even working in the office. 

Users can utilize this application to relax and stream their favorite songs, while having the option to customize playlists to either fit a mood or fit into their environment.
